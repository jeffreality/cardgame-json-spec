  <h1>Go Math: Official Rules</h1>
  <p><strong>Go Math</strong> is an educational card game where each card shows a simple arithmetic expression. 
    Your goal is to collect cards whose values match the total you’re seeking — think of it like “Go Fish” meets arithmetic!</p>

  <h2>Objective</h2>
  <p>Be the player with the most matches by the end of the game. A “match” means two or more cards whose values (e.g., 2, 10) create a valid set in your hand.</p>

  <h2>Setup</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Shuffle the entire <strong>Go Math</strong> deck thoroughly.</li>
    <li>Deal <strong>5 cards</strong> to each player (adjust for different play styles). 
        Place the remainder in the center to form a draw pile.</li>
    <li>Pick a starting player randomly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Gameplay</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Ask for a total:</strong> On your turn, pick a value you need to complete a set in your hand. For example, if you have a card “3+5” (value = 8), you might ask, “Do you have a value of <strong>8</strong>?”</li>
    <li><strong>Other player checks:</strong> The targeted player must pass you any cards in their hand matching that total (e.g., any card with value = 8). If they don’t have any, they say “Go Math!”, and you draw the top card from the center pile.</li>
    <li><strong>Continue turns:</strong> As long as you collect at least one card from the player asked, you take another turn. Otherwise, play passes to the next player in clockwise order.</li>
    <li><strong>Form sets:</strong> Whenever you have a pair (or more) of cards that total the same value, lay them down as a completed set. Keep them in front of you.</li>
  </ol>

  <div class="example">
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> You have “3+3” and “8-2,” both equal 6. You can lay them down as a completed set worth 8.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Ending the Game</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Play continues until all cards are drawn from the pile and no more matches can be made.</li>
    <li>The player who has laid down the most sets wins.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><em>Have fun, and happy learning!</em></p>
