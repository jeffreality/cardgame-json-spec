  <h1>Melee: A Hand-to-Hand Combat Card Game</h1>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>me·lee</strong> [mey-ley]<br>
    noun: a confused hand-to-hand fight or struggle among several people.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    <strong>Melee</strong> is a card game for two or more players where each player controls a character 
    and tries to survive attacks from opponents. The game borrows elements from martial arts and side-scroller 
    combat video games, translating them into card-based strikes, blocks, and special moves.
  </p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    In <strong>Melee</strong>, two or more players can trade blows (via card-play) to damage each other's 
    characters while protecting their own. Each player tracks their character’s damage on a separate 
    <em>character sheet</em>. When all the target spots on a character sheet are marked off, that player 
    is eliminated.
  </p>

  <p>
    The last player remaining with unmarked spots on their character sheet wins!
  </p>

  <h3>Character Sheets</h3>
  <p>Each player chooses a character sheet with target circles representing health. For example:</p>

  <h2>Gameplay</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Setup:</strong> Shuffle all <strong>Melee</strong> cards. Deal five cards to each player. Remaining cards form the draw pile.</li>
    <li><strong>Turn Order:</strong> Choose the youngest player to go first; play proceeds clockwise.</li>
    <li><strong>Attacking:</strong> On your turn, draw one card from the pile. Then play an <em>attack card</em> (e.g., “Strike Body”) against another player’s character.
      <ul>
        <li>If you cannot attack (i.e., you have no valid attack card), you must discard one card and end your turn. Play proceeds to the next player.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Defending:</strong> The attacked player draws a card, then either defends with a matching <em>defense card</em> (e.g., “Shield Body”) or discards a non-defense card and takes the hit, marking off one target circle on their character sheet.</li>
    <li><strong>Special Defenses:</strong> Some defense cards allow you to immediately counter-attack (“Block and Hit Back,” “Shield and Strike Back,” etc.) or reflect the attack (“I’m Rubber, You’re Glue”).</li>
    <li><strong>Elimination:</strong> A player is out of the game when all target circles on their character sheet are crossed out.</li>
    <li><strong>Victory:</strong> The game ends when there is only one player left with uncrossed targets. That player is the winner.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Card Details</h2>
  <p>
    A <strong>Melee</strong> deck has 64 cards: attack cards (hitting, striking, shooting), corresponding 
    defense cards (blocking, shielding, dodging), and special cards.

  <h2>Ending the Game</h2>
  <p>
    A player is out of the game once all targets on their character sheet are marked out. The final player 
    who still has at least one open target wins the game.
